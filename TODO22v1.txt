
      THINGS TO DO FOR THE SHEAFHOM 2.2 RELEASE
                     February 2007

Back up \mark\math\shh2 to shh22prerel.zip and put it on my geocities
site for safekeeping.

Ultimate goal: announce on comp.lang.lisp and sci.math.research.  That
will call for a short but professional abstract, plus a link to my
home page (and Lispwire if it's up to date).

First, try to Linj it.  That way, (1) I can release in two languages;
(2) the main manual can be the Javadoc, except for the major macros.

Settle on which declarations to use and which not.

Get the working copy into publishable form.  Just before publishing,
make a branch.  In the branch,
--delete group code
--don't lose the group*BLACK.lisp code on the stick
--delete group symbol exports from make.lisp
--delete (load ...group...) from make.lisp

THINGS TO POST ON MY SITE:
--installation notes in README.txt
--installation notes at the top of the reference manual(?)
--the source code
--reference manual in pdf via latex
--reference manual in html (as zip file) via latex2html

THINGS TO POST ON LISPWIRE:
--description (abstract; mine in 2.1 was too long?)
--installation notes as in README.txt
--tutorial
--other links will hopefully take care of themselves in the raw entry

-------------------- Other ideas --------------------

Write installation guide and intro in the user manual.

Lispy icon in the Java windows?
